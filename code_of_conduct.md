#Code of Conduct 

No harassment: Women Who Code is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. We will not tolerate harassment of Women Who Code members in any form, including overly sexualized or demeaning comments or anything that threatens personal safety. People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and/or the organization at the discretion of the organizers and management team.

WWCode events are intended for all women (trans and cis), trans men, and genderqueer folks who are interested in attending. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly and committed to matters of social justice as an organization. Select events may be open to the general public, which will be clearly noted in event descriptions.
